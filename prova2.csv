163740;Mirtazapine;Depression;"""I&#039;ve tried a few antidepressants over the years (citalopram, fluoxetine, amitriptyline), but none of those helped with my depression, insomnia &amp; anxiety. My doctor suggested and changed me onto 45mg mirtazapine and this medicine has saved my life. Thankfully I have had no side effects especially the most common - weight gain, I&#039;ve actually lost alot of weight. I still have suicidal thoughts but mirtazapine has saved me.""";10;28-feb-12;22

39293;Contrave;Weight Loss;"""Contrave combines drugs that were used for alcohol, smoking, and opioid cessation. People lose weight on it because it also helps control over-eating. I have no doubt that most obesity is caused from sugar/carb addiction, which is just as powerful as any drug. I have been taking it for five days, and the good news is, it seems to go to work immediately. I feel hungry before I want food now. I really don&#039;t care to eat; it&#039;s just to fill my stomach. Since I have only been on it a few days, I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ve lost weight (I don&#039;t have a scale), but my clothes do feel a little looser, so maybe a pound or two. I&#039;m hoping that after a few months on this medication, I will develop healthier habits that I can continue without the aid of Contrave.""";9;05-mar-17;35
97768;Cyclafem 1 / 35;Birth Control;"""I have been on this birth control for one cycle. After reading some of the reviews on this type and similar birth controls I was a bit apprehensive to start. Im giving this birth control a 9 out of 10 as I have not been on it long enough for a 10. So far I love this birth control! My side effects have been so minimal its like Im not even on birth control! I have experienced mild headaches here and there and some nausea but other than that ive been feeling great! I got my period on cue on the third day of the inactive pills and I had no idea it was coming because I had zero pms! My period was very light and I barely had any cramping! I had unprotected sex the first month and obviously didn&#039;t get pregnant so I&#039;m very pleased! Highly recommend""";9;22-Oct-15;4

71428;Levora;Birth Control;"""I was on this pill for almost two years. It does work as far as not getting pregnant however my experience at first was it didn&#039;t make a huge difference then 6 or 7 months into it my sex drive went down, along with being very very dry, my moodiness increased drastically. I would cry one second and then get angry with my husband over anything and everything. My skin has gotten a lot worse, I broke out in places I never had in the last week. So now I am on Yaz.""";2;16-apr-11;3
196802;Paroxetine;Hot Flashes;"""Holy Hell is exactly how I feel. I had been taking Brisdelle for 1.5 years. The hot flashes did indeed subside - however, the side affects of this medicine coupled with the fact Noven was acquired by YET another pharmaceutical company - YOU CAN&#039;T PLACE A REP IN THE AREA, DISTRIBUTE YOUR DRUGS, AND THEN FIRE HER-AND NOT REPLACE THEREFORE there is NO medicine or support here. You dumped this drug in the Dr&#039;s hands and walked away. After calling Sebula - you act like you don&#039;t even care. You have made it impossible to obtain this. I happen to think this is illegal.  I just decided to wean myself off this and Premarin. It has been nothing short of a nightmare. If you don&#039;t need this drug- DON&#039;T START.

213376;Nuvigil;Narcolepsy;"""A doctor in the ER prescribed me 200 mg of Provigil when I was first diagnosed with Narcolepsy. It didn&#039;t seem to have any effect on me at all. Then I went to see my sleep doctor and he prescribed me 250 mg of Nuvigil. It finally allowed me to stay awake for an entire day. But if I went out somewhere I would be able to come home and take a nap and be fully awake again. Taking that with Xyrem makes me feel 98%..not quite 100, but still pretty great.""";9;30-Jun-10;14

33173;Microgestin Fe 1 / 20;Acne;"""So I was on Ginanvi for about 3 months before I switched over to this pill due to the high cost of Ginavi (I don&#039;t have insurance). Ginanvi had cleared up my acne in the short time I used and I was hoping this birth control would not mess that up. I was wrong. After 2-3 months of using this pill my skin went crazy with horrible breakouts. Now, 9 months later I still have horrible acne. If you want a pill that helps with acne this is NOT it. It also made my period &quot;weird&quot;. I would have little to no period one month and a heavy one the next . The month that I had a heavier flow my boobs would hurt a lot. I also noticed that at the beginning of taking it , I would be moody and extremely irritable all the time . It&#039;s time for me to switch.""";3;22-Jun-17;1

231397;Trazodone;Insomnia;"""If I could give it a 0, I would absolutely do so.  Started at 50mg, and felt WIRED.  Wanted to get up and clean the house!  Bumped it to 100mg, less wired, but still wide awake all night.  Bumped to 150, with the same lack of effect.  MD informed me after this dose it becomes less effective for sleep, so why even bother.  15 years of trying different sleep medications and alternatives, and this, I can say for sure, was the LEAST effective I have ever come across.  At it&#039;s low price point, feel free to give it a try, and maybe you will be luckier?  Everyone&#039;s sleep conditions are different.  But if you get hyper after benadryl, expect the same reaction to this drug.""";1;18-Oct-16;15
38116;EnteraGam;Irritable Bowel Syndrome;"""I am so happy with the samples provided by my Endocrinologist. The only thing I am so sad about is that I cannot afford the prohibitive costs.

190527;Oxybutynin;Hyperhidrosis;"""This drug is pretty amazing. I&#039;ve had hyperhydrosis of the palms, soles and underarms since hitting puberty. I was skeptic since I&#039;ve previously tried botox, iontophoresis and drysol with limited results. However, after three days of taking oxybutynin (5mg 3x a day) I was 95% sweat-free. My only negative things to say about the drug is about side effects. I have gotten fairly dizzy/spaced out a few times, and I experience dry mouth pretty often. However, that&#039;s not bad in comparison to the acne I&#039;ve gotten. I used to get pimples around once a month, however now I have ones lasting for &lt;6 wks, varying in size/colour. I constantly have groups of acne on my face. Does anyone have any remedies? I&#039;ve tried acne masks, cleansers and tea tree oil.""";9;30-May-17;10

Thus far I have experienced significant improvements in controlling my bipolar II disorder. I recently paired 100mg of sertraline to improve the lows. Also, I experience rapid cycling. I rated this drug 70% as I feel I still have a long way to go in recovery. But, the drug has definitely allowed me to be a highly functioning individual.""";7;22-nov-17;1
79865;Blisovi Fe 1 / 20;Birth Control;"""I absolutely love this product and recommend to everyone. I know everyone&#039;s body is different, so it is not for everyone, but it is not the medicines fault. I have NO negative symptoms since I started this. I used to have heavy periods, terrible cramps and headaches, and my periods were super long. I now have super consistent 3-4 LIGHT periods, no cramps or headaches.

27607;Ivermectin;Rosacea;"""I&#039;ve had rosacea for almost 20 years and have been on all kinds of antibiotics. Most I am allergic to the last was erythromycin which worked okay. But the Dr though it was time for me to get off the antibiotics. I&#039;ve been on Soolantra for about 6 months and my face has never looked better. I&#039;m thrilled with everything about it. You do use just a dab so a tube will last at least 3 months if not more. I do have insurance that helps a lot with the cost but what I do pay is well worth it.""";10;01-apr-16;19
207923;Suprep Bowel Prep Kit;Bowel Preparation;"""This stuff wasn&#039;t too bad!  I had a hard time with the first dose as I&#039;m not used to very sugary drinks and such.  Because of this, I did think it tasted quite gross.  It had a strange grape salty flavor but it was only 16 oz, so it wasn&#039;t too bad to get down.  I had absolutely no discomfort or nausea.  It worked very fast and I was completely clean for the colonoscopy - this was my first colonoscopy and after having read the awful reviews of the gallon jug prep, I went for this stuff.""";8;18-feb-15;15
156919;Movantik;Constipation, Drug Induced;"""my advice on movantik is understand that movantik is an opioid blocker in the same manner that naloxone (found in suboxone) is an opioid blocker. My husband took 12.5mg and was thrown in withdrawal. Nausea first, chills, fever, shaking so hard the bed was vibrating. I thought movantik worked on the backed up s**t but it stops the opioid from working. Of course you will have diarrhea when your pain meds are cut off. It may not happen to everyone but it happened to my husband. I guess it&#039;s back to OIC""";1;26-Aug-16;24

178004;Duloxetine;Pain;"""Been on 30mg Cymbalta for 2 weeks. Started getting relief by the 2nd day. Am 58 year old male with spinal stenosis, degenerative disc disease, and spondy. Plan was to go to 60mg but I am getting enough relief at 30mg. I believe I will try to stay on that dose to minimize side effects. Some constipation, difficult reaching orgasm, some night sweats and minor headaches. Oh, insomnia if I took it at night.  I had samples of this medicine for 6 months but delayed starting it because of horror stories on the internet. Pain was ruining my life so this medicine seems to be the best option.""";9;27-mar-12;32
60341;NuvaRing;Birth Control;"""I was on this for 5 years (and birth control pills for about 12 years), and would have told you how fabulous it was.  &lt;List all the benefits everyone else has listed, here.&gt;  Then a friend of mine convinced me to stop birth control all together for a while, and I turned into a new and better person!  I dropped 5 lbs instantly, had a huge sex drive, more lubrication, and just felt better.  I wouldn&#039;t say I was depressed before, but after going off of it, I would describe my time on birth control as feeling like I was inside a cloud.  Less emotions in general, sometimes a little down.  I&#039;m bummed I&#039;m back on it, but it seems to be the least impactful than the others.  I might try Paragard to avoid the hormones.""";7;17-Jun-11;0
141462;Escitalopram;Depression;"""I am a 22 year old female college student. I wanted to write this because when I was at my lowest of low when I felt absolutely hopeless... these positive reviews are what got me through the day. I experienced a lot of change.  I was also in a relationship that made me unhappy. I stopped doing the things I liked to do such as run, party, work, hang out with friends etc. In result, I never had energy. I constantly felt guilty. I cried everyday, sometimes multiple times of day. I went to group therapy. I dropped 10lbs in two weeks. I eventually got on this medicine &amp; the first 4 days felt crazy &amp; tired! TAKE AT NIGHT. Give this medicine time! Now 3 weeks in I am back to myself and am truly happy!

At doses of 2700mg I experienced a significant improvement in impulse control and depression in general.  Went from being a shut in, to going for walks and enjoying my time in the company of others.  At the lower dose of 1800mg a day, I don&#039;t experience much improvement, save for a decrease in depressive symptoms.  I&#039;m looking forward to a larger dose if my doctor okays it.""";8;24-Sep-14;75
130301;Levonorgestrel;Emergency Contraception;"""I want to share my experience to possibly ease some of the ladies out there. The incident occur in Nov 18 (the condom broke) and it was 4 days after my period ended and approximately 4 days before ovulation. This means I was fertile.  when we noticed that the condom broke, we immediately bought Plan B One Step and was taken about 45 minutes or an hour later.  The sooner you take the greater the chances it will work. So I waited anxiously, praying I get my period. I felt side effects such as fatigue, bloated, nauseous, cramps, and moody. I was that these might be  this pregnancy symptoms.  I waited exactly two weeks and I got my period. I was the happiest person ever. My period was here early by approximately 3-4 days. Good luck.""";10;28-Dec-13;20

I&#039;m moody, irritable, depressed, hungry, bitchy... vaginal discharge has changed  (gross), my urine smells, my acne has gotten so out of hand and it&#039;s STUBBORN. Cystic acne all around my mouth, jawline, Chin and neck. After doing some research online, I discovered I&#039;m not the only one. Birth control is different for everyone but this is going in the trash... I will not be taking this any longer. It also kills your sex drive... as for the difference in bleeding, I wouldn&#039;t know. I started this pill on day 1 of menstrual cycle last month and haven&#039;t had a period yet... have had plenty of headaches though! """;1;13-Dec-15;6
79569;Plan B One-Step;Emergency Contraception;"""Our condom seemed to not have worked properly, but I had to work so I didn&#039;t take the pill until about 18 hours later. I have taken the two pill process about a year ago when the same had happened, and I didn&#039;t become pregnant then nor experience side effects that were noticeable. With this pill, I have been tired, but I am a teacher who works long hours and grades late into the evening so I didn&#039;t attribute it to the pill. I was not nauseated but took it a couple of hours before bed and was my usual tired self. My period came 5 days later with a vengance (strong cramps/heavier bleeding). It is 2 weeks early, which scared me a bit. That is why I wrote this review and sought out others. I also experienced diarrhea due to cramps being so strong.""";8;19-Jan-12;21
17957;Ethinyl estradiol / etonogestrel;Birth Control;"""I started on the oral contraceptive pill but got horrible nausea and vomiting, so this was my next option. NuvaRing has been fantastic, it has a fraction of the hormones and I get no nausea. Insertion and removing is really not a hassle, and you cannot feel it at all. For me, it beats the pill and vomiting, along with all the other symptoms. I haven&#039;t had any noticeable mood issues or migraines. I would recommend it to anyone!""";10;13-Dec-12;4
219567;Microgestin Fe 1.5 / 30;Birth Control;"""About two months ago I had to switch from LoLestrin Fe to microgestin due to my insurance and pharmacy. Since starting microgestin I&#039;ve noticed insane bloating and nausea and weird discharge. While on lolestrin, my periods consisted of spotting and average side effects, nothing too serious, but after one month of micro I got my period and it was heavy and the cramping was so painful I had to leave my class. I&#039;ve also noticed I&#039;ve developed bad depression and my mood swings are very intense. My anxiety is bad and my sex drive is very low if not nonexistent anymore. It helped with my acne but I&#039;m a lot more paranoid about getting pregnant than I was on lolestrin. I&#039;m going to be talking to my doctor about possibly getting the shot.""";1;31-Oct-16;4
171525;Wellbutrin;Major Depressive Disorde;"""Coming from a very problematic childhood, I&#039;ve been labeled everything from A to Z by psychiatrists and given a slew of meds. Wellbutrin in my experience has been beyond beneficial. At first for the first week or two I had slight tremors, irregular heartbeat, major insomnia and headaches but dismissed. I still have slight insomnia which is why I take them when I wake up. But reading comprehension, multitasking, thought focus and moods overall have dramatically improved! I&#039;m one of those people that may have to take them for the rest of my life but I&#039;m not complaining =). One thing that does bother me tho is dry mouth from wellbutrin but I take biotene which helps a bit. Enough to make it worth it anyways lol.""";8;06-mar-15;49
202002;Benzoyl peroxide / clindamycin;Acne;"""My GP had prescribed this to me at my requests for something to deal with my acne. I used this medication for about a month or a little longer. This medication dries out my face something terrible. I had to slather moisturizer on my face, which was probably counterintuitive. The medication worked well at drying out existing acne on my face but did nothing to prevent new acne. Every day I would wake up to new zits. I ended up going to a dermatologist and had something else prescribed.     Also, with this medication containing benzoyl peroxide it stains your sheets very badly (thankfully, I already had a pillow case that resisted staining, same can&#039;t be said for the sheets).""";4;26-Jan-17;2

This is only day 1 and I hope it&#039;s only the first day. I&#039;d like to think it&#039;s because the medication is reacting to the irritation from instance itching I was doing down there before buying the cream. Lol.

Then my period started coming twice a month with horrific cramps. Or I would spot for 2-3 weeks have a week where I thought It was over and started spotting again. I&#039;ve now had it for 13 months and it does the job because I havent gotten pregnant.

190325;Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo;Birth Control;"""I started off by taking regular Ortho Tri Cyclen, which helped some with my acne, but I also became severely depressed, so I went off it.  After a year and a half of not taking birth control at all, I began taking Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo for acne, and after 4 months my skin is MUCH clearer.  If I do get pimples, they are much smaller and more shallow than before, and go away quicker.  I am pleased!""";9;23-Dec-13;7

5357;Cryselle;Endometriosis;"""I started taking Cryselle almost 9 months ago to treat my endometriosis as well as to act as a birth control. My OB-GYN instructed me to skip the placebos, and as a result I have had virtually no cramping or break through bleeding (common on my last pill). However, as she warned, I developed severe acne. The acne I could deal with, but the emotional side effects I cannot. I have become increasingly moody the longer I have been on Cryselle, especially around the time of my &quot;period&quot;. I have also developed strong feelings of anxiety and depression. I had hoped when these symptoms began, that they would lessen over time, but they have just increased in severity. """;7;02-feb-14;14
13407;Amphetamine / dextroamphetamine;ADHD;"""Yes, this medication does work wonders, at first.  Diagnosed ADHD (by a Psychiatrist)  at the age of 26.  The first 3 years it worked quite well and felt like a godsend.  I took 5-6 days a week and my life demonstratively improved.  Focus, completing tasks, mental clarity, improved self-esteem...life was good.  Adderall, like other CNS stimulants, tend to become less effective after time and I noticed this more pronouncedly by my 5th year.  At that point, I felt trapped by the drug and tried to stop.  The problem was that even after a month or more without Adderall, none of discontinuation symptoms were improving.  While I continue to use Adderall for maintenance, I derive little benefit.  Be aware, the effects won&#039;t last indefinitely!""";2;20-May-15;57

I am 39 years old and finally got so  sick of wasting money and time on everything you can imagine,  even tried every old wives tales. Finally my Dr put me on this, benzol peroxide 5% and Retinal- A.     Yes  weeks 1-3 made it 30%worse but week 4 and beyond my skin looks amazing!

I was on .5 mg. Detoxing med free from this med was horrendous! After detox most of the side effects cleared up. But I still have issues with memory and concentration. This is the only med I took on a reg bases as my health was good. Im still suffering the side effects of the Withdrawl from it. Studies should be for longer than 12 weeks.""";1;4-Jun-16;16
124544;Skyla;Birth Control;"""honestly the measurement hurt more than the actual placement! And I&#039;m so happy I went through with it!!! I wish I didn&#039;t read all of these reviews before I did it. Pain is subjective and its not that bad. They explained the procedure to me and I felt more comfortable. I&#039;ve never had kids. Its just like getting a regular pap. I think it is the best option of birth control. That being said I will definitely recommend getting this! Do expect cramping for a day or two. I didnt cramp until about three hours after having it done. I took ibuprophen and slept with a heating bad. Very mild cramping today but I am happy with my choice :)""";10;14-Jul-15;3
229996;Lastacaft;Conjunctivitis, Allergic;"""I used them and within 6 hours my eyes swelled almost shut, and cheeks puffed up. 2 weeks later I still have red watery eyes, but thankfully the swelling is finally gone. I will never use this product again (obviously), but it is also incredibly expensive. I have never had an allergic reaction to any medication before so this was very unexpected.""";1;30-nov-11;36
131523;Effexor XR;Anxiety;"""I was prescribed this for onset of anxiety and possible hormonal mood swings. I was not told by my doctor how it would make me feel or how hard coming off of it would be. I took one 37.5 mg capsule and was horrified that I was given this. I woke up at 2am with an anxiety attack for about the first hour. It then went into being wired, nauseous, shakey, weak, chills and sweating. 11 years ago I quit using meth and this was awful that I felt like I was on it again. I laid in bed the entire day, wide awake and ill. I never took another dose! And even one pill took at least another full day to leave my system. My nervous system is obviously sensitive and I could not handle this medication at all.""";2;27-Aug-17;13
209386;Nifedipine;Raynaud's Syndrome;"""I started the nifedipine/Procardia this morning. About 4 hours later the rare side effects kicked in. Heart palpitations, dizziness, headache, and I was FREEZING. Even at 43 I still call my mommy. She wasn&#039;t thrilled I was going to take it anyway since I have perfect blood pressure. But she recommended laying on my left side. That did help even if it did take awhile for me to get warm again. The headache is still lingering.""";1;19-Jul-14;22
229572;Lurasidone;Schizophrenia;"""I am on day #10 of this medication and the side effects are very minimal although I am having trouble sleeping. My sleep patterns have been affected. I feel more energetic, as If I have to be doing something. My mind will not stop repeating the same thoughts, over and over again. I am also very hungry and have an increased appetite. It does however, cause me to think about things differently as I know what my general reaction to things would be, or have been in the past, but, it allows me time to think of an alternative besides being explosive. It has calmed me, and more than once, has helped me to cope with a situation differently and more calmly. Overall, I think I&#039;m doing well so far. I plan to continue this medication for some time.""";8;19-feb-15;26
105440;Afrezza;Diabetes, Type 1;"""Since I was on the trials I put 6+ months but I have been back on Afrezza for about 2 weeks.  Afrezza is nothing short of a miracle. I am a type 1 diabetic and my blood sugar average in the past 10 days has been 110. I have a CGM so I have had 2880 readings in the past 10 days.  A 110 average equals to an A1C of 5.45. This is possible because Afrezza mimics the speed of a healthy pancreas. Afrezza starts working in only 12-15 minutes and works out of my system very quickly. This allows me to manage my glucose in real time without babysitting diabetes all day. Even if I do have a high I can knock my sugars back to 100 in a matter of minutes.""";10;12-feb-15;125
201582;Zoloft;Depression;"""Zoloft did not help me at all.  I was on it for about 3 months, worked up to 100mg.  I was tired and hungry all the time.  I gained 20 lbs and slept all day. I was a complete zombie.  Definitely made my depression worse.""";1;14-Jan-13;51

The second dose almost killed me. I went to the ER, where I was stabilized enough to move me to ICU. Before I lost consciousness, my blood pressure was 35/27. I woke up 3 days later with a central line, severely swollen body, and my skin was bright red, like a severe sunburn. I spent 3 weeks in the hospital, with my blood pressure constantly plummeting. I apparently have a severe allergy.""";1;6-Dec-17;0

95748;Sertraline;Major Depressive Disorde;"""I had major depression from the time I started menstruating.  It would cycle with my cycle.  It caused paranoia, and fear of being seen outside my home.  It feared going to my mail box, yet, at times I would sign up to do things like be an Avon Lady! I felt crazy. In my mid 30&#039;s, divorced, alcoholic, my doctor prescribed Prozac.  It didn&#039;t seem to help me.  Later in recovery but still profoundly depressed, she put me on Zoloft and the result was instantaneous.  I felt like a window to my life had been opened.  I wasn&#039;t afraid.  I looked forward to getting out of bed.  I found things I liked to do. I have a healthy relationship, a good job, a life.  I have been given my life back.  Now, I am 16 years sober.  Thank you Zoloft.""";10;02-nov-14;88
6971;Aluminum chloride hexahydrate;Hyperhidrosis;"""So in high school over ten years ago I started to sweat really bad under my arms. It was super embarrassing to go through high school with this issue. After trying over the counter products and home remedies I gave up. So my Dr at the time recommended Drysol. I used it for just a few weeks and it worked so good. But then after a few months I noticed my armpits darkening. So I stopped using it. Now about 15 yrs later I&#039;ve tried so many things to lighten my armpits and nothing works. This stuff did 100% cure my sweaty armpits and I can now freely wear shirts without the sweat marks. But it burned me so bad that I have dark scars for life and still can&#039;t walk around freely with tank tops. I guess you can&#039;t win them all.""";7;05-nov-15;5
131683;Effexor XR;Depression;"""Sadly only lasted 5 days on Effexor XR. The side effects from the 75mg dose was unlike anything I have experienced before. Within 10 hours of the first dose I had severe anxiety - something I had never experienced before. Within hours of second dose the extreme nausea came on. By day 3 I was pratically bed-ridden in cold sweats and feeling completely &quot;out of it&quot; . I persevered hoping the effects would begin to subside but by the 5th day I had severe nausea, couldn&#039;t get out of bed from feeling so sick, horrible tinnitus (ringing in the ears) and felt spaced out to the point that I began to wonder if I would ever feel &quot;normal&quot; again. Advised by GP to cease immediately on hearing my side effects.""";1;24-apr-16;18
188604;ParaGard;Birth Control;"""I had paragard for a year and a half and had cramping the whole time with terrible long heavy periods.  The last couple months I had it I was in so much pain I could hardly walk. Went to my doc and she said nothing seemed wrong.  Then the next day I went to the ER and had it removed. It had slipped a little and was causing a lot of discomfort. I will never get an IUD again. I&#039;m lucky I didn&#039;t need surgery like some women""";1;29-Jan-16;4
19559;Pregabalin;Generalized Anxiety Disorde;"""Pregabalin for me was miraculous. On the first dose (75mg three times a day) my anxiety was reversed. I really thought this was too good to be true. I have tried Prozac and lorazepam at different times of my life. But as is commonly known, after the fourth or fifth trial of SSRIs, they &quot;peter out&quot; and actually become counter productive, even in some cases causing serotonin syndrome. But about two years ago, I was in a very stressful marriage break-up and was taking benzodiazepines to keep the lid on the anxiety, with little effect. The GP respected my wish to try Lyrica. I was and still am, after two years, astounded by this transformation. I feel like I always felt I should feel. A cessation of anxiety and a sense of well being pervades. """;10;31-Jul-13;228

The flow is light however the length of my average period is 2 weeks when I wasn&#039;t on birth control. So maybe the medication is altering my system %u2026I do feel nauseous and I crave like crazy. I do feel a little depressed because my period isn&#039;t gone yet but overall it  seems to be a good birth control so far. """;9;16-Jul-11;4

I fill like I&#039;m having a bad cycle every day and walking intensifies the pain this is a every day feeling. My doctor tried me on Ultram and it has been a God send. I take it three times a day.

122089;Venlafaxine;Depression;"""I was first prescribed Effexor 13 years ago and was taking 225 mg. I was on it for a few years and stopped taking when I was pregnant with my first child. I was put on Paxil (gained so much weight) and then Zoloft. I took the Zoloft off and on for years until it just wasn&#039;t working for me anymore. I was then put on Welbutrin while still taking 25mg of Zoloft. I quit smoking (had no desire to smoke) but then became suicidal. My doctor then put me back on Effexor and I currently only take 75 mg. I feel amazing. Yeah the side effects are bad, I&#039;ve gained weight (lost weight the first time I was on it), have sexual side effects, and get quite shaky/jittery if I&#039;m late on a dose.

The worst of it was around 3:45 am I woke up shaking uncontrollably falling over couldn&#039;t see straight it felt like I was being electrocuted it was to the point I either wanted to be knocked out or die .

My period came two weeks earlier and it was really bad. Had big blood clots, really heavy period. The cramps were terrible. It was an unpleasant experience. BUT no baby. So that&#039;s good. Really helped. Really wish guys would go through this too. It&#039;s really unfair all we women go through.""";10;20-mar-16;14

However, when I switched to try the generic, it did neither.  Now my insurance wants to make me pay a fee for not being able to use the generic. A fee that equals the list price of the medicine without insurance.  I can not afford to go from 100.00 copay for a 3 month supply to 1300.00 for the same amount.""";10;29-Jan-15;45

Now I&#039;m having more trouble with it than ever before with walking pain, sleeping pain, knee resting pain, it&#039;s all worse I&#039;m 40 and walk like I&#039;m 80. Physical therapy was a joke considering my condition can&#039;t be fixed without replacing the knee.

The day after I got it the bleeding significantly reduced, and today it&#039;s hardly bleeding. First day was the worst but definitely doable. As far as being emotional. The first day I was very irritable but I&#039;m assuming it was because I was hurting and hungry all day. Other than that I&#039;ve been great!""";10;26-Aug-15;1

I am glad I found this medicine because I don&#039;t have to take it daily and I no longer feel as if I&#039;m going insane.
